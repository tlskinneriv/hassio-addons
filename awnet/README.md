# Home Assistant Add-on: AWNET

Local data transfer between Ambient Weather weather station and Home Assistant.

## About

You can use this add-on to take advantage of the new "Custom Server" feature in AWNET available in Firmware [4.2.8](https://ambientweather.com/support) on the WS-2902A, WS-2902B, WS-2902C, WS-2000 And WS-5000. I have tested this using my WS-2902C. It presents a webserver that will accept the polling from the WS device. It then calls a service provided by the [Ambient Weather Station - Local](https://github.com/tlskinneriv/awnet_local) custom integration to ingest data.

This add-on and integration combo are a work in progress. Any feedback and/or contributions are appreciated. Credit to [dancwilliams](https://github.com/dancwilliams) for the [initial add-on](https://github.com/dancwilliams/hassio-addons/tree/master/awnet) that this was forked from.
